# Changes
I used a random speed with the max speed capped by the slider input to make the game more interesting.
I used a circle button insteqad of rectangular to fir the circle theme better.

# Considerations
I remove the element after the click or after the animation end to not overload the DOM.

I used % instead of px for the width to accomadate changes in the width of the screen while the game is played.
